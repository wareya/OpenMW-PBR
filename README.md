# Wareya's PBR shaders for OpenMW

Based on OpenMW commit 55107e0913.

Very basic minimally invasive PBR shaders for OpenMW 0.49 builds. Based on revision 55107e0913. Don't install unless you know what you're doing. Make a backup of the vanilla shaders folder by COPYING it (NOT by renaming it), then copy these shaders over the base ones.

Implements basic lambert diffuse lighting and schlick-ggx specular lighting. Lighting math is done in (approximately) linear light. Configuration is in lighting_pbr.glsl.

These shaders attempt to automatically generate roughness data if there's no PBR specularity material available. To disable this, set `PBR_AUTO_ROUGHNESS_MIN` and `PBR_AUTO_ROUGHNESS_MAX` to the same value (0.75 for example).

Supports PBR specular materials. Red: metal, green: roughness, blue: ambient occlusion. If you want to use PBR materials where green is smoothness instead of roughness, change `PBR_MAT_ROUGHNESS_INVERTED 0` to `PBR_MAT_ROUGHNESS_INVERTED 1`.

Make sure you have these settings set in settings.cfg to avoid any possible issues:

```
force shaders = true
clamp lighting = false
force per pixel lighting = true
light bounds multiplier = 5
lighting method = shaders
```
