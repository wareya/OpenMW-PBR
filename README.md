# Wareya's PBR shaders for OpenMW

Very basic minimally invasive PBR shaders for OpenMW 0.48. Based on revision 3b669c2b02. Don't install unless you know what you're doing. Configuration is in lighting_pbr.glsl. Implements basic lambert diffuse lighting and schlick-ggx specular lighting. Lighting math is done in (approximately) linear light.

These shaders attempt to automatically generate roughness data if there's no PBR specularity material available. To disable this, set `PBR_AUTO_ROUGHNESS_MIN` and `PBR_AUTO_ROUGHNESS_MAX` to the same value (0.75 for example).

Supports PBR specular materials. Red: metal, green: roughness, blue: ambient occlusion. If you want to use PBR materials where green is smoothness instead of roughness, change `PBR_MAT_ROUGHNESS_INVERTED 0` to `PBR_MAT_ROUGHNESS_INVERTED 1`.

Make sure you have these settings set in settings.cfg to avoid any possible issues:

```
force shaders = true
clamp lighting = false
force per pixel lighting = true
light bounds multiplier = 5
lighting method = shaders
```
